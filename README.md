# Code Quiz

## Weekly Project #4

Use this nifty website to test your knowledge of JavaScript.

Just click "Get Started!" to, well, get started!

This website uses JavaScript to dynamically edit HTML elements to display necessary information to the test-taker (you!). Alongside all that crazy stuff, an active timer limits the amount of time that can be spent on the test. Make it to the end of this incredibly difficult quiz, and you just may be able to enter your initials for all that sweet, sweet local-storage-flavored fame we all crave. Good luck!
